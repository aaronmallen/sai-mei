An elegant color naming system extending Sai with sophisticated color palettes

Sai-Mei (彩名) - combining Sai's color management with the on'yomi reading for 'name' - provides a comprehensive
collection of named colors extending the Sai color management system. Drawing inspiration from traditional color
vocabularies, Sai-Mei brings rich, curated color palettes to terminal interfaces.

Sai-Mei empowers developers to selectively incorporate sophisticated color collections into
their CLI applications. Like its parent gem Sai, it combines precision with flexibility,
allowing developers to organize and utilize color palettes with fine-grained control.
